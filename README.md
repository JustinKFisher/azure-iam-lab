# 🛡️ Azure IAM Lab using Microsoft Entra ID

This lab simulates real-world Identity and Access Management (IAM) scenarios using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). Inspired by NFL team roles, users are created as player personas and assigned roles based on their "position" and access needs.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Azure Entra ID
- Azure CLI
- Microsoft Azure Portal
- PowerShell
- GitHub

## 👤 User Theme
Users are modeled after NFL offensive roles: Quarterbacks, Running Backs, Tight Ends, Wide Receivers, and Offensive Linemen. Each group has been assigned realistic resource access and RBAC roles.

## 🧪 IAM Concepts Practiced
- User & Group Management
- Resource Groups
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- MFA Simulation
- Incident Response (Compromised Account)
